## Lord Of The Objects

### Overview
The objective of the game is to survive and overcome the challenges that you face.
You will lose when the condition of your car hits zero.
You win by Teleporting home when you overcome your challenges, and if your condition does not hit zero.

### How to Play
You are trying to get home and you have to select from the three 
vehicles avaiable to you. You have to overcome the obstacles blocking your path.
### Technologies Used
My partner and I used Inheritance in our project, and also we have an array containing the three obstacles. We set it
so that the obstacles are chosen randomly.

+ Java
+ Object Oriented / Inheritance
+ Markdown

### Lessons Learned

I learned that private isn't visible to child classes.
I learned setting an array to choose an element inside randomly, and having it not repeat itself is very diffcult to do.
If possible I would like to avoid using it again.
